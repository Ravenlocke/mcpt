Welcome to mcpt's documentation!
================================
``mcpt`` is a Python 3 library for calculating p-values through Monte Carlo permutation tests, providing an intuitive, simple, and highly customisable interface to determining statistical significance.

To get started, we recommend you work through Installation, Quickstart, and Functions pages. Also check out the FAQ, which we update regularly. If you have concerns about the software, or feel that there is something that should be more explicit, then we'd love to hear from you -- `please open an issue on Github <https://github.com/Ravenlocke/mcpt/issues>`_ and we'll get back in touch ASAP.

If you use ``mcpt`` in your research, please support us by citing the initial release:
