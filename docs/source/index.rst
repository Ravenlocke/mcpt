Welcome to mcpt's documentation!
================================
``mcpt`` is a Python 3 library for calculating p-values through Monte Carlo permutation tests. ``mcpt`` provides an intuitive, simple, and highly customisable interface to determining statistical significance.

To get started, we recommend you work through Installation, Quickstart, and Functions respectively. Also check out the FAQ, which we update regularly. If you have concerns about the software, or feel that there is something that should be more explicit, then we'd love to hear from you -- `please open an issue on Github <https://github.com/Ravenlocke/mcpt/issues>`_ and we'll get back in touch ASAP.
